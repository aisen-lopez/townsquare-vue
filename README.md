This is an online tool to run Blood on the Clocktower games through Discord or other digital means.
It is supposed to aid storytellers and allow them to quickly set up and capture game states for their players.

[You can try it online!](https://bra1n.github.io/townsquare)

**Todo:**
- add night sheet data to roles.json
- add night sheet view to Grimoire
- add global reminder space
- add LICENSE and finish README (shortcuts)
- (maybe) switch to vectorized SVG token icons
- allow using custom scripts

WORK IN PROGRESS
